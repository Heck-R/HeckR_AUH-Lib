# HeckR_AUH-Lib

This repository is only a collection of scripts which either I created unrelated to any project, or are commonly used by my other projects.

Note, that I did not create most of these scripts, and I did modify a few of them slightly, so if you need them separately from my projects, you should probably get them from the original source. I provided links below to the original creators and to the sources. All credits should go to them, but neither they nor I take any responsibility for any damage caused by using these in any way, shape or form.
